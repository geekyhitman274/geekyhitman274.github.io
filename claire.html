        </div><p class="row" id="pimg" ><img src="data/af.jpg" align="middle" class="row flag"><b>Claire Hale Underwood</b> (born 1965) is the 47th and current President of the United States, assuming office after the resignation of her husband <a>Francis Underwood</a>. She is the first woman to serve as President. Prior to this she served as the 51st Vice President of the United States. She was also the first women to serve as Vice President. In her career she also served as Acting President of the United States, 46th First Lady of the United States, and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Before moving into the White House, she was the Chief Executive Officer of Clean Water Initiative until she handed it over to her Office Manager <a>Gillian Cole</a>.
        <br>
        Claire Hale Underwood was very close to her father; her mother stating: "You got away with murder". This paternal closeness resulted in a strained relationship with her mother,<a>Elizabeth Hale</a>. As Claire moved from childhood to adolescence this strain turned to estrangement. Claire Underwood's mother always told her to frown less and smile more but never considered her personal feelings were in the way of her happiness; she just couldn't smile from the inside out.<br>

        Claire was the CEO of the Clean Water Initiative. A charity non-profit organisation intended on bringing clean, drinkable water across developing, impoverished countries. During her tenure, she proved to be just as ruthless and pragmatic as her husband. One example was firing half of the CWI staff due to unavailability of funds after Frank was not made the Secretary of State. Also, one of the main reasons for her even working at CWI is simply to make herself and her husband seem like caring individuals.<br>

        When she and Frank moved into the White House, Gillian Cole (despite the fact that she was fired) became the CWI's new CEO, after a nasty fight between Claire and her about Gillian's healthcare plan for her unborn child. Claire ended the argument saying, "I am willing to let your child wither and die inside you if that's what's required."<br>
